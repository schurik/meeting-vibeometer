# Use Github MCP

- When asked to interact with git or github prefer using the Github MCP tools over plain git commands
  
- github owner: schurik
- github repository: schurik/meeting-vibeometer

- NEVER change files remote

- When creating an issue:
  * use concise and clear title
  * be presize on the description and do not generate to much text
   
- When asked to start implementation of an issue:
  1. create the new branch AND checkout it localy
  2. push branch to remote
  3. ALWAYS checkout new branch
  4. ALWAYS proceed with the implementation on LOCAL branch
  5. at the end commit, push and create pull request
 
- When creating new branch:
  * allways create new branch from main branch
  * use branch prefixes:
  * for new feature use: feature/
  * for fixing a bug use: bug/
